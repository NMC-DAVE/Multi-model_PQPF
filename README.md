There are two versions of the supplemental locations code.   The older of the two is compute_precip_analog_locations_ccpa9.f90.
A newer, more general version is supplemental_locations_eighth_degree.f90.   This uses information on the analyzed precipitation climatology generated from the python script compute_precip_analysis_gamma_cdf_parameters.py.

The data used for the latter supplemental locations code can be found by ftping to ftp.cdc.noaa.gov (anonymous/email) and then cding to /Projects/Reforecast2/netcdf/NationalBlend .
